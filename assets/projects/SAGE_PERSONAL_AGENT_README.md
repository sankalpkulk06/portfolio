# Sage - Personal Agent

A **local-first, privacy-respecting personal AI assistant** that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with persistent memory, live news, and intelligent conversation. Sage is your personal study companion with personality-answering questions about your documents, remembering what you tell it, fetching live news, and maintaining full conversation context.

**No cloud. No tracking. Everything stays on your machine.**

---

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### **1. Smart Chat with Tool Calling** 💬
- **Natural language understanding** - ask for things naturally without commands
- **Automatic tool invocation** - model decides when to fetch news, save facts, add todos
- **Persistent session history** - conversations are saved and can be resumed later
- **Multi-turn context** - LLM remembers everything said in the session
- **Resume any session** - `sage --resume <session-id>` to continue where you left off
- **Session management** - list, view, and organize chat sessions

### **2. Learned Facts** 🧠
- **Remember personal facts** - `/remember-personal Your favorite hobby is reading`
- **Remember work facts** - `/remember-work I lead the ML team`
- **Smart categorization** - personal and work facts organized separately
- **Automatic context** - facts are automatically injected into responses
- **Manage facts** - view all facts, delete unwanted ones, organize by category

### **3. Selective RAG Retrieval** 🎯
- **Conversational questions** (greetings, meta-questions) - skip document retrieval entirely
- **Document-based questions** - retrieve and cite sources only when needed
- **Smart pattern detection** - knows when to use docs vs. just chat
- **Fast responses** - no embedding latency for casual conversation

### **4. Live News Fetching** 📰
- **Natural language news queries** - "What is the news on NASA today?"
- **Direct news command** - `/news SpaceX` for instant formatted news
- **AI-generated summaries** - get a consolidated summary (under 200 words) of all articles
- **Topic extraction** - automatically extracts topics from questions
- **Full sentence search** - `/news What happened with the Mars launch` works perfectly
- **Persistent news context** - follow-up questions remember the articles
- **Proper citations** - news sources cited separately from documents

### **5. Sage Reminders & Todos** ✅
- **Sage-owned reminders** - `/todo Buy oat milk` stores a reminder in SQLite
- **Natural language reminders** - "remind me to take the trash out at 8PM today"
- **Proactive WhatsApp delivery** - `sage serve` schedules and sends due reminders
- **Natural language due dates** - `/todo Buy milk @tomorrow` or `/todo Call mom @next Tuesday at 3pm`
- **Missed reminder recovery** - a fallback scanner catches reminders missed during restarts
- **Apple Reminders opt-in** - `/apple-reminder ...` only writes to macOS Reminders when explicitly requested

### **6. Document Management** 📚
- **Multi-format support** - `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf` files
- **Bulk ingestion** - `sage ingest --path ./documents/`
- **Metadata tracking** - file size, type, date, checksums
- **Vector embeddings** - semantic search across all documents
- **Citation system** - all answers cite exact document sources

### **7. Personality-Driven Responses** 🎭
- **Named assistant** - "You are Sage - a wise, knowledgeable personal companion"
- **Natural tone** - conversational, not robotic
- **Context-aware** - different response style for personal facts vs. document answers
- **Thoughtful advice** - like a trusted advisor, not a search engine

### **8. Conversation Analytics** 📊
- **Usage patterns** - track total sessions, turns, and conversation frequency
- **Activity insights** - discover your most active days and times
- **Command statistics** - see which commands you use most
- **Topic analysis** - understand your top question types
- **Fact insights** - review learned facts by category
- **Dashboard view** - `/analytics` command for visual stats

### **9. Web Search** 🌐
- **Live web answers** - ask factual questions and get current, cited answers from the web
- **Automatic routing** - LLM decides when to use web search vs. RAG vs. news based on intent
- **Tavily primary** - fast, LLM-optimized results (1,000 searches/month free)
- **DuckDuckGo fallback** - works without an API key
- **Cited responses** - every web result includes title and URL
- **Explicit shortcut** - `/search <query>` to always hit the web directly

### **10. WhatsApp Integration** 💬
- **Chat over WhatsApp** - send any message to Sage from your phone via the Twilio sandbox
- **Persistent sessions** - same phone number always resumes the same conversation
- **All commands work** - `/todo`, `/news`, `/search`, `/remember-*`, natural language - everything available in chat
- **Long reply splitting** - responses over 1600 chars automatically split across multiple messages at sentence boundaries
- **`sage serve` command** - starts a FastAPI webhook server Twilio forwards messages to
- **ngrok-friendly** - works locally with ngrok for dev; any public HTTPS endpoint for prod
- **Twilio usage tracking** - `/usage` shows daily CLI chats, WhatsApp chats, and outbound Twilio quota

### **11. Proactive Briefings & Habit Nudges** ⏰
- **Morning briefing** - daily WhatsApp summary of habits, news, and due reminders
- **Habit nudges** - asks about unlogged habits at the configured nudge time
- **Fast nudge replies** - reply `done` or `skipped` to log a habit without going through the LLM
- **Scheduler lives in `sage serve`** - proactive behavior runs while the webhook server is up

### **12. Gmail Email Triage** 📧
- **Fetch personal inbox** - pulls recent primary-tab emails via Gmail API
- **AI-powered triage** - classifies each email as ACTION, FYI, or IGNORE
- **Actionable summary** - surfaces what needs a reply or decision
- **Chat-native** - type `/email` or just ask naturally ("check my email", "any emails to action?")
- **Standalone command** - `sage email-personal` for a quick triage outside chat
- **Filters automatically** - skips promotions, social, updates, and forums

### **13. Configuration & Customization** ⚙️
- **Environment variables** - all settings configurable via `.env`
- **Custom assistant name** - change who you're talking to
- **Retrieval depth** - adjust how many documents to retrieve (in-session)
- **Chunk size & overlap** - fine-tune document chunking
- **Max results** - control news and email result counts

## 🤖 How It Works: Open Source Tool Calling

Sage uses **open source Ollama models with tool calling** - the model understands when to call tools based on natural language, without needing explicit commands.

**The Flow:**
1. **You ask naturally:** "What's the news on Tesla?" or "Remember that I like coffee"
2. **Model understands intent:** Identifies that it needs to fetch news, search the web, save a fact, etc.
3. **Automatically calls tools:** Generates JSON with the tool name and parameters
4. **Tools execute:** Fetches news, searches the web, saves facts, adds Sage todos, searches documents
5. **Model responds:** Incorporates tool results into a natural response

**No `/commands` required** - but they still work as shortcuts if you prefer them.

Example:
```
you: What is LangGraph and can you add it to my reminders?
Sage: I'll search the web and add a reminder.
[Tool: web_search(query="What is LangGraph")]
[Tool: add_todo(task="Learn LangGraph", due_date="today")]
→ According to [1], LangGraph is a framework for building stateful multi-agent workflows...

```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Ollama installed and running
- 2GB+ RAM available

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd personal-agent
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start Ollama

```bash
ollama serve
```

In another terminal, pull the models:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text      # Embeddings (small & fast)
ollama pull llama3.2:3b           # Chat model (lightweight)
```

### First Steps

```bash
# Show configuration
sage config

# Ingest your documents
sage ingest --path "./my-documents"

# Start chatting!
sage chat
```

### Docker / Keep Sage Running

Use Docker Compose to keep the WhatsApp webhook server, scheduler, and optional Ollama service running in the background.

```bash
# Build the Sage image
docker compose build

# Start Sage + Ollama in the background
docker compose up -d

# Pull the required models into the Ollama container
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Watch logs
docker compose logs -f sage

# Stop services
docker compose down
```

Your Sage state is mounted at `./data`, including SQLite, Chroma, reports, and Gmail OAuth tokens.

If you already run Ollama on your Mac instead of in Docker:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.host-ollama.yml up -d --build
```

Useful one-off commands:

```bash
docker compose run --rm sage sage config
docker compose run --rm sage sage sources
docker compose run --rm sage sage ingest --path /app/data/documents
docker compose run --rm sage sage chat
```

Note: Linux containers cannot create native macOS Apple Reminders. Sage-owned SQLite reminders, WhatsApp delivery, Gmail triage, RAG, URL ingestion, and webhook serving still work in Docker.

```

### Sage Reminders, Apple Reminders, and Usage

In chat mode, use `/todo` to add Sage-owned reminders to SQLite. These reminders are sent over WhatsApp by `sage serve` when due. Apple Reminders is explicit opt-in via `/apple-reminder`.

```bash
# Basic Sage reminder
/todo Buy milk

# Optional Sage list/category label
/todo Buy groceries #Shopping
/todo Pay utilities #Bills
/todo Review PR #Work

# Add with due date
/todo Call mom @tomorrow
/todo Meeting @next Tuesday at 3pm
/todo Workout @3pm

# Natural language reminder
remind me to take the trash out at 8PM today
remind me to call mom tomorrow morning

# Combine list and due date
/todo Dinner prep #Personal @6pm
/todo Project deadline #Work @next Friday
/todo Anniversary #Important Dates @April 15

# Explicit Apple Reminders
/apple-reminder Buy printer paper #Office @tomorrow
```

**List syntax:** Use `#ListName` to attach a list/category label. For `/todo`, this is stored in Sage's SQLite todo table. For `/apple-reminder`, this chooses the Apple Reminders list.

**Date patterns:**
- **Relative:** today, tomorrow, tonight, next Monday, next week, etc.
- **Specific dates:** April 15, 2026-04-20, April 15 at 9am
- **Times:** 3pm, 9:30am, 14:45, etc.
- **Combinations:** next Tuesday at 3pm, April 20 at 6:30pm

**Usage tracking:** `/usage` reports daily CLI chats, WhatsApp chats, and outbound Twilio WhatsApp messages. The Twilio count is outbound-only because inbound WhatsApp webhooks are tracked separately as chat activity.

---

## 📧 Gmail Setup

Email triage requires a Google Cloud OAuth 2.0 credential.

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (Desktop app)
3. Download the JSON and save it as `data/credentials/credentials.json`
4. On first run (`sage email-personal` or `/email` in chat), a browser window opens for Google sign-in
5. The token is saved to `data/credentials/personal_token.json` - future runs are silent

**Required API:** Enable **Gmail API** in your Google Cloud project.

---

## 📱 WhatsApp Setup

Requires a free [Twilio](https://twilio.com) account and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for local dev.

1. **Twilio** - grab your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** from the [Console dashboard](https://console.twilio.com/console). Activate the WhatsApp Sandbox under **Messaging → Try it out → Send a WhatsApp message** and note your sandbox number.

2. **Add to `.env`:**
   ```env
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886
   TWILIO_DAILY_MESSAGE_LIMIT=50
   ```

3. **Join the sandbox** - from WhatsApp, send `join <sandbox-name>` (shown on the Twilio page) to `+1 415 523 8886`.

4. **Start the server and expose it:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   sage serve

   # Terminal 2
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

5. **Wire up Twilio** - in the Twilio sandbox settings, set **"When a message comes in"** to:
   ```
   https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app/webhook   (HTTP POST)
   ```

6. **Send a message** from WhatsApp to the sandbox number - Sage replies.

### Proactive Scheduler Setup

Proactive reminders, habit nudges, and morning briefings run inside `sage serve`. Keep that process running for scheduled WhatsApp messages.

Add these to `.env`:

```env
SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true
MORNING_BRIEFING_TIME=08:00
HABIT_NUDGE_TIME=21:00
YOUR_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155551234
```

Scheduler behavior:
- One-time Sage reminders use APScheduler `date` jobs.
- Pending future reminders are reloaded from SQLite on startup.
- A one-minute fallback scanner catches reminders missed during downtime.
- If Twilio rejects a send, Sage logs the failure and does not mark the reminder as notified.
- Usage alerts are sent once per day when outbound Twilio usage reaches 25, 45, and 49 messages. The 49-message alert consumes one message and effectively brings Twilio usage to 50/50.

### Recommended Ollama Models

**For Tool Calling (recommended):**
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b           # Excellent tool calling, good speed
ollama pull mistral:7b            # Very good tool calling, fast
```

**For Speed (lightweight, but less reliable tool calling):**
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:3b           # Smaller, but tool calling less reliable
ollama pull nomic-embed-text      # 274MB - fast embeddings
```

**Note:** Smaller models (3b) have lower tool-calling accuracy. For best results with tool calling, use `llama3.1:8b` or `mistral:7b` (requires ~8GB RAM).

**For Embeddings:**
```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text      # Fast and effective
ollama pull all-minilm:22m        # Better quality, smaller than others
```

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Scenario 1: Research with Follow-ups

```
you : What is the news on climate change today?
# Fetches 5 articles about climate change

you : What are the main solutions mentioned?
# Re-uses cached articles, LLM answers in context

you : Tell me about renewable energy
# Switches to document search (new topic)
# Clears news cache, does RAG
```

### Scenario 2: Personal Knowledge Base

```
you : /remember-personal I have a dog named Max
you : /remember-personal Max's birthday is July 15

you : When is Max's birthday?
# Sage remembers from learned facts

you : /facts personal
# Lists all personal facts with dates
```

### Scenario 3: Work Context

```
you : /remember-work I work on the payment system
you : /remember-work My team has 4 people

you : Tell me about payment systems in the book
# Sage knows you work on payments, includes in context
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Ollama not connecting

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/version

# Start Ollama if not running
ollama serve
```

### No embeddings error

```bash
# Ensure embedding model is pulled
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# Check it's available
ollama list
```

### Out of memory

- Use smaller model: `mistral:7b` instead of `llama2:13b`
- Reduce `CHUNK_SIZE` in `.env`
- Free up system RAM

### Gmail credentials not found

```bash
# Ensure credentials.json is in place
ls data/credentials/credentials.json

# On first run, a browser window opens for Google sign-in
sage email-personal
```

If the browser doesn't open, check that your Google Cloud project has the Gmail API enabled and the OAuth client is a Desktop app type.

### Chat feels slow

- Reduce `RETRIEVAL_TOP_K` in `.env` (default: 5)
- Use `/topk 3` in chat to retrieve fewer documents
- Switch to faster model in Ollama

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Optimize for Your Use Case

**For research:**
```bash
sage config
# Increase RETRIEVAL_TOP_K to 10 in .env
sage chat --top-k 10
```

**For quick answers:**
```bash
# Use single question mode
sage ask "Quick answer?"
```

```bash
# Session mode remembers everything
sage chat
sage --resume <id>
```

### Best Practices

- **Session management** - `/sessions` to find relevant past conversations
- **Topic switching** - start a new session for different topics
- **Fact cleanup** - use `/forget` to remove outdated facts
